# PineconeInfiniteMemoryChatbot
I integrated this into a discord bot among other functionality, I'll update at a further date with a better description, but its just out now so people can have it :P

I use azure cloud hosting for storing files larger than the discord file upload limit and providing url to the files in the case that they are too large for your server.
I'm sure this could be modified to work locally, I'd just rather not work with 4 different api's just to handle files.

Let's use Pinecone to give a basic chatbot INFINITE MEMORY
